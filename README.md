## Background

The Project visualizes correlation between data from U.S census Bureau and BRFSS

## Task


1. To find a correlation between two data variables, each measured state by state and taken from different data sources. 
2. Visualize the correlation with a scatter plot and embed the graphic into an .html file. 

#### 1. Data
1. https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml.
2. https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Behavioral-Risk-Factors/BRFSS-2014-Overall/5ra3-ixqq. 


#### 2. Visualize the Data

Using the D3 techniques, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements.

* The x-values of the circles is demographic census data, while the y-values  represents the risk data.

* State abbreviations in the circles.

* Chek for correlation between data.
